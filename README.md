# Dataquest Guided Project: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis.
So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction
Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.

A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.

For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

### Methods Used
- combinations
- permutations
- probability

### Technologies Used
- Python
    - Pandas
## Next Steps
Possible features for a second version of the app include:
- Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines "You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery").
- Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.
